# Improve-Resolution-using-Autoencoder
In this project, youâ€™re going to learn what an autoencoder is, use Keras with Tensorflow as its backend to train your own autoencoder, and use this deep learning powered autoencoder to significantly enhance the quality of images. That is, our neural network will create high-resolution images from low-res source images.

# Objective :-
The Objective of this project is :

1. Understand what autoencoders are and why they are used

2. Design and train an autoencoder to increase the resolution of images with Keras

# Project Structure :-

The hands on project on Image Super Resolution Using Autoencoders in Keras is divided into following tasks:

1: Project Overview and Import Libraries

2: What are Autoencoders?

3: Build the Encoder

4: Build the Decoder to Complete the Network

5: Create Dataset and Specify Training Routine

6: Load the Dataset and Pre-trained Model

7: Model Predictions and Visualizing the Results
